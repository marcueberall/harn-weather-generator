## Execution

## Usage
You can set the latitude, climate zone for the region you want to generate the weather for using the drop down boxes. For easier referencing, you can look-up the corresponding values from the map above.

Then you can specify the date and the number of days to generate the weather for. The resulting weather information is formatted in simple markdown style.
